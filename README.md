Duke University Java Capstone Project - Movie Recommender 
by Jason Espinoza

## About
This capstone project is a recommender system. The program data for is for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. The program will answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, this program will:

1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
